# CallOnHold_MASTERS1
The premise of this project is to develop and specify technologies based on the "Call on Hold" service offered by SIP. This service consists of the interaction that the user will have access when a new call is sent to him, while he is in another call. The user will be able to use the keyboard, that is, produce inputs via keyboard, in order to interact with the second call, and may have the following options: hold the call in which he is 4 involved, establish a dialog between the participant of the original call and an answering machine or even, start a conference involving all participants, the manager will be able to start a conference and add the employees that are registered and selected for the conference. For this we use two types of servers (Proxy and Registrar).
